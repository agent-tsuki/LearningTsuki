# Write your answers below each question
# ======================================================

# Q1: Print the numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop.
# Hint: Use range(1, 6)


# Q2: Print your name 5 times using a for loop.
# Hint: Loop from 1 to 5 and print your name inside the loop.


# Q3: Print "Hello" 3 times using a for loop.
# Hint: range(3) gives 0,1,2 → so loop will run 3 times.


# Q4: Print numbers from 1 to 10.
# Hint: Use range(1, 11)


# Q5: Print numbers from 10 down to 1.
# Hint: Use range(start, stop, step) → step can be negative.


# Q6: Print only even numbers from 1 to 20.
# Hint: Even numbers are divisible by 2.


# Q7: Print only odd numbers from 1 to 20.
# Hint: Odd numbers give remainder 1 when divided by 2.


# Q8: Print the square of numbers from 1 to 5.
# Hint: Multiply the number by itself inside the loop.


# Q9: Print the multiplication table of 2.
# Example:
# 2 x 1 = 2
# 2 x 2 = 4
# ...
# Hint: Use range(1, 11)


# Q10: Print numbers 1 to 20, but:
# - If divisible by 3 → print "Fizz"
# - If divisible by 5 → print "Buzz"
# - If divisible by both → print "FizzBuzz"
# Hint: Use if-elif-else inside loop.


# Q11: Print each letter of your name on a new line.
# Hint: Loop directly over the string.


# Q12: Count how many times the letter "a" appears in a word.
# Hint: Use a counter variable (count = 0) and check each letter.


# Q13: Find the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.
# Hint: Keep adding numbers inside the loop.
